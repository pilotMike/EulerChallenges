# EulerChallenges
The purpose of this project is to contain the Euler Challenges and their solutions as I work them out. Not all of the challenges
are in this solution. I tried to strike a balance between code readability and performance. There are some projects that I couldn't solve for whatever reason and decided to go to the next problem instead of trying to continue to solve it; as such, there's no guarantee that all of them will be right, though almost all of them do.

The Euler Tools project is the library what contains the helper tools used for the various challenges.
